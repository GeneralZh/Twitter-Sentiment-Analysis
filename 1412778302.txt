@wildpursuits @Broncos @Colts my hubby is catching me up on him... lol
@wolfman708 @abitx2u @Tenpointer20111 @MAnotGinger @gagirlxo @popstherock33 @sawmilltaters @misdado1 not sure... Arizona, I guess
@wildpursuits @Broncos @Colts I don't know any of the Cardinals... at least I don't think I do... lol
What a total class act...\n#PeytonManning
Oh my... #PeytonManning... more tears...\n#AFCChampionship
@wildpursuits @Broncos @Colts I don't know who I like for the next game... whoever the Broncos can beat easier, I guess... lol
@wildpursuits @Broncos @Colts even my hubby, die hard @nyjets fan, loves #PeytonManning !!!!
@DavidYeater @wildpursuits @Broncos I've been wanting this for him so so bad... I am so happy right now, what a game!
@wildpursuits @Broncos @Colts I've loved Peyton since I watched him play for Tennessee... he is one of the greats, no doubt!
@abitx2u @Tenpointer20111 @wolfman708 @MAnotGinger @gagirlxo @popstherock33 @sawmilltaters @misdado1  Not today... not today... #BroncosWin
@wildpursuits @Broncos I have tears running down my cheeks... so happy for Peyton!

Let's go #Broncos!\n#AFCChampionship #NEvsDEN
@mmmadcccow I actually made it!  LOL  Two paint sticks with my fabric tape measure taped to them...  #inventor #ducttape  #itworks
@Archerymadness That's crazy Gary... stay safe my friend!
@wildpursuits Oh my... that doesn't sound good at all...

I'm thinking french toast &amp; then a nap... catch you all later...\n#CentralPA #blizzard2016 #BeCarefulOutThere
@trapper831 I sort of like snow... it is so pretty before it gets all dirty and stuff... I could never live in a place with no snow
@wildpursuits Good Morning my DE friend! How are you holding up?  We are getting a lot more than I expected, 12" at 8AM &amp; still snowing
@trapper831 I thought it was going to stay South... I was only thinking we would get like 4"... I thought WRONG!  lol
@Minuteman223 Thanks!  I am planning on a nap here shortly... lol
@trapper831 I should have done that!  I really didn't think we would get this much though...
@HBSeedCo Main campus Penn State... he is one of the guys that has to shovel snow... no shut down for him  :(
@Minuteman223 we had 12" at 8AM, still coming down &amp; I don\'t have a yard stick... hubby made it to work safely though  :)
@HBSeedCo I just heard from him, he made it to work safely... shoveling that sidewalk kept me sane while he was traveling  :)
@trapper831 I'm going to have to look for a tape measure because I don't have a yard stick... lol
That is what is left of a 12" ruler when I tried to measure our snow... lol
12" &amp; still coming down, hubby is on his way to work so I guess I will go out &amp; shovel the sidewalk... #blizzard2016 https://t.co/sw1CK7J7bd
Made it home safely... #blizzard2016  #4wheeldrive #CentralPA #besafeoutthere
Snowing in State College... 5 more hours of work to go...  #blizzard2016 #CentralPA #staysafe
Heading to work... no snow now but it be a different story when we come home... #blizzard2016  #DriveSafe
Hope you all have a great day... those in the path of Jonas, #staysafe!  I'm looking forward to snow pics! https://t.co/htFyAZZvz9

Nice stop.  #GoBroncos
@Mil_HandF take care... prayers
@88husker that's how I feel about the Steelers... I can't root for them... here in Central PA everybody tries to shove them down your throat
@johngutierrez1 @Minuteman223 OMG... I will be praying, praying, praying...

@johngutierrez1 @Minuteman223 we need a TOUCHDOWN
It's about time... now do something!\n#GoBroncos #PITvsDEN
Denver needs a pick...\n#PITvsDEN
@Minuteman223 @johngutierrez1 that was no touchback...
How is that a touchback???\n#PITvsDEN
You gotta catch the ball...\n#PITvsDEN
Ouch.\n#PITvsDEN
@Tolltac Horrible... just horrible... your boys are looking good...
Do I really look like this?\n#GoBroncos #PITvsDEN #PeytonManning https://t.co/G4X4wwLN0F

@HStafford18 Central PA... at that time Iived beside the Juniata River... 5 feet of water in the house on January 19-20
@HStafford18 It isn't always snow covered, but we travel it to go to work... floods can't be fun either, my house was flooded in '96
Did you get your ticket?  I got mine!\n#PowerballFever #FeelingLucky #DreamingBig https://t.co/Ar4rtPXGpM

@Mil_HandF what's the topic?  #huntchat
@rebelpride02 probably stock it with like 1500 packs of Ramen noodles... lol... seriously, I read you can keep them for like 10 years!
@Firechief41 I have 5 so far too... but I bought them at the same store.  All my Powerball numbers are different so far though... lol
@Firechief41 Heck no... I didn't even win a single dollar... BUT I already started buying tickets for Wednesday!  #PowerballFever
@rebelpride02 Yes!  I would get an awesome bunker!  \xf0\x9f\x98\x83
The wind is howling in #CentralPA... almost sounds like a train at times...
@timc3425 shhhhhh... it isn't over yet... don't jinx them... lol
@DavidYeater @CamoCandace me neither \xf0\x9f\x98\x91
Any other day, I would be celebrating a Packers win already, but the way games have been going this weekend, I'll wait!\n#GBvsWAS
Hoping the #Packers walk away with a win today... so far the games have been something!\n#GBvsWAS #NFLWildCard
Unreal...\n#SEAvsMIN

@CU_L8R_Nutz OMG... it was NUTS!  Bengals lost their heads
@Tolltac congrats my friend!
@Tolltac crazy
@Tolltac I am glad you didn't go to sleep regardless of the outcome!
@Tolltac this game is NUTS
@Tolltac hang on!  Holy smokes
@Tolltac sorry about your Steelerzzz... that was a crazy game
Oh. My. God.\n#PITvsCIN
@Tolltac I am sitting here in shock... I really didn't think they would score... you guys got almost 2 minutes
Holy crap... I really didn't think they were even going to come close...\n#WhoDey #PITvsCIN
Holy smokes, this crazy football game made me forget what time it is, I didn't even look at the Powerball number\n#PITvsCIN #PowerballFever
@Tolltac just wanted to warn ya... wouldn't want you to wake up and be like WTH
@HayekandHockey meanwhile... looks like Burt Reynolds is quarterbacking for Pittsburgh... #PITvsCIN
@IronChefCMAC @SOSGEARMT @Tolltac @mbabs21 stick to what you know is good!
@Tolltac um... Bengals scored and Ben is out...
@Tolltac this game is crazy
@MissMcB76 I know it is... but Steelers got that call in the 1st half &amp; it wasn't even helmet to helemt
No flag???? Seriously??? He led with his helmet!  #PITvsCIN

Second time it looked like offensive pass interference to me...\n#PITvsCIN
@singerz_808 it's only like $40 worth... some tickets only have one play on them
@bklear1970 @mbabs21 aww.... I bet their little personalities are beginning to show
@bklear1970 @mbabs21 well I bought several.... I will build her a little house for them if I win. \xf0\x9f\x98\x83
@bklear1970 @mbabs21 not even if you win the Powerball tonight????
@SOSGEARMT @johngutierrez1 I have a list of people in a tablet dating back to 1999... it would be awesome to surprise them!
@bklear1970 @mbabs21 looks like you will have to build on a room for them... lol
@SOSGEARMT @Tolltac @mbabs21 I will always order from you &amp; get the quality I am used to instead of buying elsewhere
@SOSGEARMT @Tolltac @mbabs21 I've looked at other paracord items at shows... none compare to your work Chelsea!  You take pride &amp; it shows!
@bklear1970 @mbabs21 I would be in trouble... I would want to keep them ALL!
@bklear1970 @mbabs21 omg... they are so adorable
Go Bengals!  (not a fan... just for anybody playing #TheSteelers)\n#WhoDey

@HinesPAhunter sorry to hear about your uncle... prayers
@Tolltac pfffftttt... not in this bleeding blue and white Penn State house!  LOL
Operation Christmas Gift is complete... all gifts are wrapped, bagged, and tagged.\n#accomplished #tistheseason
Good Morning and Happy Friday!  Another busy day, hope to catch up with Twitter this weekend!  Have a good one and remember to SMILE!  :-)
@Mil_HandF @ozarkcustomcall @WestAugusta @HBSeedCo I was at work... and now I am going to bed... good night
@wildpursuits Love it!  "Jesus Christ is Risen Today" is one of my favorite hymns and this is right up that alley!  :)
@wildpursuits Sounds like I better have a tissue on hand... thanks for the warning!  :)
@bklear1970 One sad part about Christmas Break is Graduation... some of our kids are getting ready to leave for the big world!
@bklear1970 See, that's why I love my job.  It's all about the people &amp; relationships, watching them grow over 4 years... omg... *tears!*
@wildpursuits I'm gonna check it out after lunch!
@bklear1970 :-)
@bklear1970 I'm at University Park Campus = 40,000+ students! It's all good, I love my job! Sometimes its a little harder to love, but I do!
@bklear1970 Well, at least you can be there in the morning, have an early lunch, then take a big nap before work! #lookingforabrightside
@bklear1970 My nephews tease me about being a janitor, I'm always like, Don't care! Best job ever cause of Christmas Break!  LOL
@bklear1970 UGH!  What hours do you have to work?
@bklear1970 Christmas Break is definitely one of the greatest benefits of cleaning up after those students all year... #PSU #janitorslife
@bklear1970 Don't you even have anybody to take turns with? I mean, I know, some jobs require it, I understand that, but I wouldn't like it.
@bklear1970 BOO!  Hats off to the people that have to do it!  I remember working the day before and day after, but never Christmas day...
@wildpursuits Soul patches for everybody!  :)  Seriously though... awesome tunes!  Chalking this up for today\'s "learn something new"  TY!
@bklear1970 Christmas break is a paid break (not vacation time) from Christmas thru New Years... this year we finish Dec 23 and return Jan 4
SIX more days of work until Christmas break...\nI love Christmas break!  :-)
@SOSGEARMT Congrats on 2 years!  :)  And THANK YOU for all the amazing products!
@wildpursuits His patch sort of reminded me of somebody... hmmmmm... wonder who?  ;-)
@SOSGEARMT After reading your latest blog... remember to count that "didn\'t pee pants" blessing when the bear came to visit!  I prob woulda!
@wildpursuits 1st time I ever heard this song... very cool.  Thanks for sharing this!
@CamoCandace Gorgeous tree!
@CamoCandace Hoping all moves forward as smoothly as possible... prayers!

@ddogsbbq Thanks Darin!  :)
@DanSherbondy It would be nice to get some snow at some point!  I am anxious to see the deer harvest report... crazy season here. #nodeer
I love snow for Christmas... but it doesn't look like it will happen in #CentralPA this year... \n#truth
@SOSGEARMT Great read, Chels!  I have been scared of bears since I was a child &amp; ran into one while squirrel hunting with my Dad...
@CamoCandace Prayers  &lt;3
I think it will look amazing when they are done! https://t.co/q968yDrzhF

@wildpursuits @CamoCandace I was wondering the same thing!  LOL
@ABBestphotos I love these hares!  I wish we had them here, if we did I would feed them!  :-)
@johngutierrez1 Negative... no deer this week... thick fog ruined our plans Monday &amp; it was still around Tues &amp; Wed... I slept in today

@mmmadcccow I haven't heard this song in forever!  LOL  It's playing in my head right now though...  :-)
@SOSGEARMT go to work that day, so it's solo hunt or nothing.  It's weird, but I love the rush of solo hunts, even when I do get scared!
@SOSGEARMT Love this Chels and I can relate but it's the bears that scare me... lol.  I solo hunt because Ed won't go with me if we have to
@SOSGEARMT I'll be watching  :)
@SOCOPowerMan @SOSGEARMT I know they get really busy... but I try to keep track of all of my packages this time of year  :)

Good Morning!  Too foggy when we woke up at 4:45AM, so we went back to sleep until now  :)\n#huntchat #GoHuntPA
@Tolltac yes sir... one buck and seven does jumped up and ran out all at once... they were running and he was a little overwhelmed
@Tolltac NEVER!  We're going after that 8 point Monday morning...
I was SAD to see the sun go down this evening... no deer on our truck.\n#GoHuntPA #huntchat #deerseason2015 https://t.co/WOSOBDYSyc
I was GLAD to see the sun this morning... welcomed it's warmth!\n#GoHuntPA #huntchat #deerseason2015 https://t.co/wuQfk7E9DY
@Tolltac negative  :(  hubby missed a buck AND a doe today... I was up at the foot of the mountain and all the action was down low :(
@HuntFiber with a view like that, who could blame you?  lol
@wildpursuits @bucksabound It's the crab... it's all about the crab... lol
@mmmadcccow SNOW!!!  Lucky girl!  :)  Good luck!
@HuntFiber Wow Linds... that is just gorgeous!
@wildpursuits @bucksabound Yes, he did!  A sight like that makes me miss summertime and Delaware!
@bucksabound @wildpursuits OMG... this is making my mouth water... looks delicious!
@ABBestphotos Love this... it looks amazing!
Sad ending to the search for the missing hunter... https://t.co/BGLGEuBi4e

@thgrace78_grace I don't have an automatic one, but mine is retractable, I am short &amp; I couldn't pull mine back with a normal cocking device
@teamregulators Continuing to pray...  &lt;3
@rm123077 I hope you have a wonderful middle of the week!
Good Morning!  It's a wet #WoohooWednesday in #CentralPA so I stayed in bed this morning.  Rain, rain go away!  :)
@pabirdhunter I leave for work at 3:45PM so I don't get to hunt the afternoons...
@LocalHunters Couch?  Pffft... I am going back to bed!
@mmmadcccow I am home already... rain and fog here this morning... not feeling it when I can't see more than 20 yards.  Blah. Good luck!
and now I am going back to bed... dreary rainy day... bed sounds good\n#HappyDecember1st #itiswhatitis
And this is why I am home already... rain and fog on the mountain... no thank you.\n#GoHuntPA #AtLeastIGotOutOfBed https://t.co/bNOvPNpYnc

It's been a long day... glad to be warm and dry now... pretty tired though... Good Night Twitter!
@CamoCandace Our rifle season opened today but I didn't see any deer... hoping to have better luck at some point!
@mmmadcccow Only until 10AM at the latest... got to go to work tomorrow but at least I can do short morning hunts with our shift
@Modern_Predator we didn't have any wind... such a weird day here... no wind, cold, then drizzle and light rain... blah.
@StackSr11 Stopped by looking for a pic of a #BBD... hope you had some luck!  We struck out today... I didn't even see a deer  :(
@teamregulators Sounds like he is a fighter... hoping he stays strong... sending prayers and more prayers
@teamregulators Oh my Andy... I just saw this... saying prayers and hoping for the best...
@MSHunts @Modern_Predator We can't shoot doe until Saturday, I didn't see any but hubby saw 5.
10 1/2 hours in the woods &amp; didn't see a deer... a little frustrating but still better than going to work!\n#GoHuntPA #huntchat #openingday
@Modern_Predator Congrats on the 3!  I didn't see a freakin deer at all today... maybe tomorrow.
Time to head to the woods.  Good luck hunters!  #GoHuntPA #openingday #huntchat #huntsafe

@mmmadcccow I'm like... dude, my family is a GUN family... sorry for being raised the way I was but hey, we all HUNT!  So, I feel ya!
@mmmadcccow I\'ve heard it 4ever. I\'m friends with some bow hunters who think there is nothing else,they say guns are "cheating" #sadbuttrue
Well, it's the night before deer season... our rifle season opens in the morning.  Good luck to all hunters &amp; #HuntSafe!\n#GoHuntPA #huntchat

@CamoCandace Congrats on showing the #OptOutside how it is done!
@CamoCandace So awesome!  Congrats!  Looks like a Please Pass the Piggy Day instead of a Happy Turkey Day!
@PAGameComm we went turkey hunting but we didn't find any so all I have is a picture of woods  :) https://t.co/mVbzag5A68

@bklear1970 @SOSGEARMT I wish!  When the day comes that we move to the river, I will be getting a dog.  Living in town in no place for one
@bklear1970 @SOSGEARMT I saw that... I wish I had a dog... I don't think my cat would wear a glow in the dark collar...
@bklear1970 I just saw that Chels is running a sale... trying to figure out what I can order from @SOSGEARMT that will glow in the dark...
@bklear1970 That boy needs some junk in his trunk...  ;)
@bklear1970 hmmmm... I will have to check those out... thanks for the suggestion!  :)
@bklear1970 I just wear hip boots... can't find chest waders  :(
@bklear1970 I\'d pay it... I\'d take out a mortgage... LOL  I am 5\'1" with small feet and a big butt... I havent found waders to fit yet
@bklear1970 I wish somebody would do custom waders... like put in your shoe size, inseam, and hip measurement then they could fit perfect!

@johngutierrez1 Thanks John!  I am pretty proud of him... that is his 1st buck in #PA... he got one in Montana before but never here
@johngutierrez1 may have been a little chilly to be wading around in mud
@johngutierrez1 oh hey... my nephew got a buck last night!  Woulda been a nice 8 but his left G4 was broke off... pic on my profile
@johngutierrez1 geesh... glad ya made it!  lol
@msfdfirefighter @SOSGEARMT Thanks Skeet and I hope I get some tomorrow so I can post a pic!  :)
@msfdfirefighter @SOSGEARMT I am new to waterfowling (2nd year) and I miss a lot... so I don't have any jewelry yet.  But I keep trying!  :)
@msfdfirefighter @SOSGEARMT Thanks!  Central PA on the Juniata River... our season comes back in tomorrow
@msfdfirefighter @SOSGEARMT You're welcome!  I will be out in the morning, hoping this wind dies down or maybe blows me some Mallards!
@msfdfirefighter @SOSGEARMT Awesome!  :-)
I am glad that I live where I do... the world is a scary place.  #GodBlessTheUSA \n#PrayersForParis

@EastSiideRyda I am not real find of heights!  My hubby just uses a piece of rope and a caliper to hook to his bow
@EastSiideRyda I hunt out of a hut that is 5 feet off the ground with a ladder so I don't use a rope... I also use a ground blind
@bklear1970 @DamonGobbler33 I am sure you guys gave 110% and that's all you can do...
@bklear1970 you did all you could do... hopefully he will be ok
@Modern_Predator @HollyGattoFit They always blame it on the farmers... my question is what do the farmers have to do with State Game Lands
@johngutierrez1 I will keep that in mind if I am ever in Nebraska!  \xf0\x9f\x98\x8b
The sun is shining in #CentralPA and I must go...\nhope you all make the most of this beautiful day!

@S_P_Waterfowl @Flintlocker @Mil_HandF I am gonna try to kill these buffleheads this weekend  \nhttps://t.co/sKp6rnKnAN\n#huntchat
@S_P_Waterfowl @Flintlocker @Mil_HandF and that is why ALL DUCKS MUST DIE!!!  #KillEm #waterfowl #huntchat
@Mil_HandF @WestAugusta I just read that... thank goodness!  #huntchat

@WestAugusta @Mil_HandF can turkeys get Lyme disease?  *fingers crossed* *don't break my heart*  #huntchat
@Flintlocker @Mil_HandF I am getting closer to not hunting deer... ducks will do for me!  #huntchat
@WildGameStore @Mil_HandF yuck.  #huntchat
@Mil_HandF Awesome... thanks for a fun informative hour!  #huntchat \nWho knew diseases could be fun???  lol
@WildGameStore @Mil_HandF ugh... it looks weird... I don't like it.. lol #huntchat

@ww_TR_do @Flintlocker @Mil_HandF @beckmanrl that's why I am not even hunting where it is posted in #Pennsylvania #huntchat
@GeneGalitz @Flintlocker @beckmanrl lol.. do you have Chronic Waste Disease out west?
@Mil_HandF Nope  #huntchat  Tell me about this...
@beckmanrl @Flintlocker @Mil_HandF very strict rules but also very wise #huntchat
@Flintlocker @Mil_HandF @beckmanrl agreed... #huntchat
@HBSeedCo @Flintlocker @WildGameStore @Mil_HandF I wouldn't eat it... I won't even hunt in a CWD area... taking ZERO chances #huntchat
@Mil_HandF @Flintlocker @beckmanrl If a deer would eat something growing there it could get the disease... #CWD #huntchat
@Mil_HandF @Flintlocker @beckmanrl I read that if CWD gets in the ground from decomposing carcasses it lasts for years #huntchat
@Flintlocker eat it before you leave  :)  #huntchat
@beckmanrl @Flintlocker that is why they are taking such drastic measures... taking no chances!  #huntchat
@Flintlocker @beckmanrl take a picture  ???  #huntchat
@Mil_HandF Area we hunted  last 2 years is posted for #CWD this year. I'm not hunting there.  I don't want anything to do with it. #huntchat
@Mil_HandF If an area is posted for CWD in #PA, you MUST have it checked before removing it from the area  #huntchat
@Mil_HandF and now it is spreading all across the country... so sad  #huntchat
@bklear1970 good luck in the morning Brian... I hope you find him!
@Mil_HandF going to do my best to follow along while watching #TWD... lol
@SpeedyW1 Howdy!  :)  #huntchat

@luke90689 that is cool... I can't afford to buy Avian X decoys... lol
@luke90689 I just ordered a goose call from @BeavrCreekCalls... hopefully the geese will be around on Saturday
@HStafford18 very sad... stupid uncalled for penalties... I was not very happy the way the game ended
@luke90689 I have heard of Avaian X but not the other one
@luke90689 no no no... I am on the Military Hunting and Fishing pro staff... just a member of Ducks Unlimited
@luke90689 nope... and I am duck hunting this weekend so the deer will have to wait
@CamoCandace We always have hot wings during #NFLSunday... but the pheasants are soaking to eat this week!  #EatWildGame

@johngutierrez1 awesome... love this pic!  So happy for you!  \xf0\x9f\x98\x81
@wildpursuits @bucksabound wow... he is a monster!  Congrats to your friend!
@bklear1970 @GeneGalitz I try and try... I just can't do it... @duckdan777 tried to teach me... I can quack but my feeder call is a FAIL!
@GeneGalitz @bklear1970 I think it sounds good...I have trouble doing the feeding call... lol
@GeneGalitz I love the look!  Very nice!
@bucksabound Woohoo!  Congrats Lance!  He's a stud!
@mmmadcccow Well girl, hubby just informed me that lunch is ready!  Get out there and bag some bunnies!  Ttyl and have fun!!
@mmmadcccow I would too if it tested negative.  We are going to hunt the Locke Valley area instead since we got our doe tags for that WMU.
@mmmadcccow If I had a deer test positive, I would not want to consume it anyway.  Just going to stay clear of Sideling Hill this year...
@mmmadcccow You have to get it checked before you even take it out of the area. We have other areas to hunt so I don't want to deal with it.
@mmmadcccow I told my hubby I am not going there.  Deer hunting just isn't the same when you have to worry about CWD.  :(
@mmmadcccow It is scary sad... we had planned on hunting that ground until my brother told me about the signs.  We hunted it last year.
@johngutierrez1 Congrats John!  He is gorgeous!!!  What a stud!
@mmmadcccow Don't get me started on the Sunday thing... lol.  I love our Gamelands... CWD has reached one in Fulton County though  :(
@bucksabound So exciting!  Congrats Lance!  I hope you find him!  :)
@wildpursuits Good luck!
@mmmadcccow Good luck to you!  I hope your pups get a good workout and chase the bunnies out for you!
@mmmadcccow Well, if the pheasants don't cooperate the squirrels may be in trouble...lol  Are you going out this weekend?
@PAGameComm Very cool... I was $.25 off in my guess  :)
@mmmadcccow YES!  :-)  We are going to State Game Lands for pheasants and I am taking some turkey shells along just in case...
Good Morning!  Happy Friday to you all!
@ddogsbbq Thanks Darin!  #TGIF

@Stoney_ATA I don't know what to think about this whole deal, she had ZERO scent block... I think that deer wanted to die  ;)  lol
@wildpursuits then I asked how big was he, she said MONSTER!  LOL  So even though he is a 6 pt, I am gonna call him Monster... God love her
@wildpursuits when she text me that she got one, I asked her if it was a good shot, she said yes,  was sure she shot him right in the heart
@wildpursuits got her license on SUNDAY EVENING... sighted and shot the xbow on Monday morning, in the woods 20 mins and boom, SUCCESS!
@wildpursuits Crazy luck right there, she took a few shots out of my xbow on Sunday, decided she wanted one, went &amp; traded a shot gun,(cont)
@RAKSBigGame Thanks guys!  :-)
@Stoney_ATA We forgot to tell her than she doesn't need to wear orange for archery... LOL  But she got him anyway!
@wildpursuits Thanks Tom!  I'm one proud stepmom!  He is her first deer ever, she just started hunting last year at 28 years old...

@awbsro @Mil_HandF @Flintlocker oh my!!!  LOL  I didn't get punches, I just got evil looks... but I still learned fast!  #huntchat
@SpeedyW1 we're frying up squirrels, running from bears, and chasing turkeys with dogs... #huntchat
@WestAugusta @Mil_HandF @Flintlocker Thank you #TenthLegion brother... I will read that after I have a slice of pizza!  #huntchat
@Flintlocker I think I was 6 when I saw a bear while squirrel hunting, traumatized me for life! I ran for the truck, Dad chased the bear!
@Mil_HandF @Flintlocker now, if I got in trouble for stepping on a stick what the heck would happen if I would have a bell??? lol #huntchat
@mmmadcccow good night!
@Flintlocker I was too scared to fall asleep... I was always looking for bears!  (and I still do that  LOL)  #huntchat
@WestAugusta @Mil_HandF @Flintlocker my Pap used dogs when he was younger, but he never talked about hunting turkeys with them... #huntchat
@WestAugusta @Mil_HandF @Flintlocker wow... thanks Steve!  I never ever heard of using dogs on turkeys, not even from my Pap... #huntchat
@Flintlocker my earliest memories of hunting are "watch where you walk, don\'t step on sticks!"  #huntchat
@WestAugusta @Mil_HandF @Flintlocker I will have to check that out.  #huntchat
@WestAugusta @Flintlocker holy cow... a freakin turkey dog?  That is awesome!  I never heard of such a thing...  #huntchat
@Flintlocker My Dad forced me!  BAHAHAHA!  He started dragging me when I was 3 or 4... hmmmm... but I guess I liked it... lol  #huntchat
@WestAugusta @Mil_HandF @Flintlocker I don't think we are allowed to use dogs for turkeys in #PA... at least I never heard of it #huntchat
@WestAugusta @Flintlocker Last fall we just kind of waited for them to walk by... lol...our technique sorta sucks but Matthew &amp; I did double
@Flintlocker I'm HOPING &amp; PRAYING that our grandson will finally man up and shoot a shotgun this year... he isn't really into hunting  :(
@WestAugusta @Flintlocker Oh don't worry... I'll be looking for those darn birds this fall also... #EvilBirds #Huntchat #FallTurkey
@Flintlocker @Mil_HandF @EidenQueen @SteveVDK_hunter I am so ready to shoot at some ducks... #huntchat

@Mil_HandF me.  I have never received a #Huntchat sticker.  :(
@JUSTINGRUVMAN @wildpursuits yes sir.  9-8
@EidenQueen @Flintlocker now I am trying to finish that pizza order... multi-task fail... lol  #huntchat

@Flintlocker I'm all wound up...I met Tom (@wildpursuits) this morning &amp; we didn't even plan it! Now I want #PA to win this game!  #huntchat
That's how you do it... we need two more guys!  #WhyNotUs #Pennsylvania #LLWS2015
@Flintlocker What's going on?  I am watching the #LLWS2015... #huntchat  and ordering pizza, and tweeting... #multitask
@JUSTINGRUVMAN no no no... LOL... just a fan of the game of baseball... love watching a good game but hoping #PA will win!
8-6 #SouthCarolina... 6th inning... come on kiddos...
@JUSTINGRUVMAN PA has 2 outs, SC just got a triple to take the lead
and #SouthCarolina pulls ahead... 7-6 in the top of the 6th.  Keep your heads up and let's do this #RedLand #Pennsylvania! #WhyNotUs
One batter... 10 pitches and counting... 3-2 count... #LLWS2015
Crazy 6th inning going on... #LLWS2015
One out away... #Pennsylvania #WhyNotUs #LLWS2015
3 outs away from moving on... good luck #RedLand #Pennsylvania!  #WhyNotUs #LLWS2015
@buckhunterky awesome!
@JUSTINGRUVMAN thanks
@JUSTINGRUVMAN still playing... going into the 5th... PA 6 SC 4
What a battle... 10 pitches to strike him out... #RedLand #PA #LLWS2015
I never looked this good when I played Little League Baseball... I was too busy picking dandelions and looking at birds...\n#LLWS2015
boom.  #SouthCarolina is back in this game... protect your lead #RedLand #Pennsylvania!\n#LLWS2015
@IhuntILLINOIS I thought my grandson was a big kid, he is 5\'1" 120 pounds at 11 years old... I guess he isn\'t that big!  LOL
12 years old, 5\'10", and 179 pounds... what the heck kind of air are they breathing down in #SouthCarolina?  ;-)   #LLWS2015
I am happy that #PA is winning, but I feel bad for the #SC kids... it has to be tough to play at that level so young... #LLWS2015
@wildpursuits yeppers... and ya know what, if we're crabbing and look a mess, who cares?  :)  Just makes me smile that we finally met...
God is my shield.
@wildpursuits I thought about the fact that we didn\'t do a pic too, but I wasn\'t exactly "picture ready" today! haha I was a crabbing mess!
Catching up from the weekend and watching #baseball... BUT I should really being doing laundry... lol
@wildpursuits You know it!  :)
@wildpursuits We were supposed to be there at 8 but we didn't get there until 9... yep, it was meant to be today!  Our gang ended up with 27
@wildpursuits and we probably would not have seen each other... I do believe God plays a part in everything!  ;)
@wildpursuits It was great to see you too!  Crazy thing is if you would have been 10 minutes earlier I would have been on the other side,
Crabbing in #DE this morning, and who pulls in?  @wildpursuits forgot a crab pot and came to get it so FINALLY I met Tom!  What a surprise!
Home in time to watch #Redland represent #MidAtlantic in the #LLWS2015!  #WhyNotUs!  Good Luck boys!
@EidenQueen Thanks Sis!  :)
@wildpursuits awwww.. thanks Tom!  And it was like seeing an old friend!  I am so glad that we FINALLY met in person!

@SpeedyW1 I wish you luck on your hunt and just watch for those sparkly collars  ;)  #huntchat

@Flintlocker @SpeedyW1 good for the jerk... I mean, his brakes must have worked... #huntchat
@SpeedyW1 I read that story and shared it. I think he was just a total *sshole!  I mean, come on, let those ducks grow up so I can shoot em!
@WestAugusta @Mil_HandF I did that also, but since we weren't home over the weekend, I haven't messed with it much yet  #huntchat

@bklear1970 you will have to let me know if the mystery gets solved... I should try to go to sleep, been laying here for almost an hour now
@bklear1970 maybe it is laying somewhere nearby ?  Just seems odd...
@bklear1970 just seems awful fishy... something that big just doesn't disappear without a picture being captured

@bklear1970 @SpeedyW1 @UnicoiCallShow @Flintlocker he used the spring loaded, snap shut, traps for everything... Fox, muskrat, racoon, mink
@Flintlocker @bklear1970 @SpeedyW1 @UnicoiCallShow crazy... I never heard of anybody eating them... we always trapped for the fur
@bklear1970 @SpeedyW1 @UnicoiCallShow @Flintlocker my Pap's traps are really old... they snap shut... not sure what they are called
@bklear1970 @SpeedyW1 @UnicoiCallShow @Flintlocker I never knew people ate coons.... tel me more!
@UnicoiCallShow @bklear1970 @Flintlocker I can remember when my Pap could get $50-60 for a nice coon back in the '80s, those days are gone
@UnicoiCallShow @bklear1970 @Flintlocker I'm hoping to see these boys later this year so I hope they don't fight too much!
@UnicoiCallShow @bklear1970 @Flintlocker a lot of coons in our woods... and I don't know anybody that traps them anymore  :(
@UnicoiCallShow @bklear1970 @Flintlocker Wow... 10-14 is awesome!
@UnicoiCallShow @bklear1970 @Flintlocker If these two fight it could get UGLY... they are both pretty good sized!
@UnicoiCallShow @bklear1970 @Flintlocker 1 was def a gobbler, other 3 couldn't tell, but 0 poults... I hope the hard rain didnt get them
@Mil_HandF it's a grandkid trip... which means crabbing and beaching... we are going to fish at the end of August... all big kid trip!  :)
@bklear1970 I wish I woulda had a video of when they jumped and ran... O.M.G.  It was heart pounding crazy beautiful!  #VENISON!
@Mil_HandF I'll be at the beach next Sunday... sorry boss... been so busy this summer so far!  #huntchat
@UnicoiCallShow @bklear1970 @Flintlocker I've seen 4 turkeys in the last 2 weeks... no poults though  :(
@bklear1970 @Flintlocker thanks guys... I was freaking out... never seen two like that together around here before!
@Flintlocker @Mil_HandF dang... and I thought it was like "food week" or something...  #huntchat
@Flintlocker @SpeedyW1 no GPS in my camera... lol  I just checked  :)  #huntchat
@DblReedOutdoors @SpeedyW1 @Mil_HandF Agreed!  You MUST be responsible!  #huntchat
@Flintlocker well... there were 2 of them... hmmmmm...  ;-)  #huntchat
@bklear1970 the one in the front was laying down... wish I woulda had my tripod, they were 150yds out, couldn't get real clear pic #huntchat

@aka_felony If they can't figure it out this time I am going to tell dad to take him there if he gets pains again
@bklear1970 thanks Brian!  He's my hero and I just want him to be okay and get some sleep...love this man so much...
@aka_felony thanks girl... this place is crazy... I mean just give him a room so he can try to get some sleep already!
@johngutierrez1 thanks John!  He is so tired, I keep telling him to just rest his eyes but he won't listen, he's 95 and does what he wants!
